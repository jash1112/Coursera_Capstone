Accident prediction is important for optimizing public transportation, enabling\nsafer routes, and cost-effectively improving the transportation infrastructure, all in order to make the roads safer. This project is focusing on predicting the accident severity based on different attributes like locations, weather, road and visibility conditions, cause of different vehicles, collision due to inattention, rough driving by influence of drugs or alcohol and so on.

Since we would like to identify the factors that cause the accident and the level of severity, we will use SEVERITYCODE as our dependent variable Y, and try different combinations of independent variables X to get the result. Since the observations are quite large, we may need to filter out the missing value and delete the unrelated columns first. Then we can select the factor which may have more impact on the accidents, such as address type, weather, road condition, and light condition."
